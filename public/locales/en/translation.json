  "frontend": "Since my teenage years, I've always been passionate about coding. I vividly remember the moment I discovered HTML tables, and from that point on, I couldn't stop exploring. The idea of creating something tangible using just a programming language fascinated me. This initial curiosity drove me to deepen my knowledge, and ever since, I have continuously learned and experimented, refining my skills at Aulab, where I truly grasped the potential of what programming can offer.",
  "backend": "Back-end development was initially an entirely new territory for me. Before joining Aulab, I had never explored this aspect of programming and it felt outside of my comfort zone. However, through dedication and determination, I managed to grasp the fundamentals and overcome the early challenges. Every day, I strive to learn something new, and my curiosity pushes me to constantly grow, embracing each challenge with enthusiasm.",
  "webdesign": "Web design has always been an integral part of my journey. I have a natural passion for aesthetics and harmony, which is reflected in every project I undertake. I possess a strong sense of visual composition that I aim to convey through my work. I love using Photoshop as a key tool in my creative process, allowing me to bring my ideas to life. For me, design is just as essential as functionality, and I strive to balance both aspects in all my projects.",

  "exp2": "I enrolled in Aulab to gain professional structure and practical training. The intensive bootcamp gave me the opportunity to work on real-world projects, strengthen my backend skills with PHP and Laravel, and solidify my understanding of databases, authentication systems, and RESTful APIs. I developed a full web application with a complete authentication flow, integrated AI APIs, Google Vision, and Stripe payments. I also practiced version control with Git and worked in team-based environments using Agile methodologies.",

I learned to troubleshoot and fix bugs across both client-side and server-side logic, developed custom items, jobs, and interactions, and gained hands-on experience in configuring a full RP server environment.",
  "exp5": "Additionally, I managed key server resources, optimized performance, and coordinated the implementation of gameplay mechanics. I frequently edited Lua-based scripts, created custom configurations, and integrated external tools.",
